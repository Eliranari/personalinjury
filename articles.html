                <p>The popular notion that there exists some kind of universal “duty of care” which is owed by 
            us all to each other  may explain the increasing use of the expression in public discussion of 
            the  supposed  incompetence  or  misconduct  of  individuals,  companies  or  public  authorities.   
            But  lawyers  at  least  must  be  careful  to  distinguish  between  a  “duty”  which  is  better  
            characterised  as  a  social  obligation  and  true  legal  duties  or  responsibilities  which  are  
            enforceable by claims for damages.
